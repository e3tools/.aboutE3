## Software Development Methodology

The following chapter describes our philosophy and approach to software development.
We outline the core principles that guide our work, emphasizing the importance of
usability.

Our methodology is designed to put our end users first, allowing a co-creation approach
with communities and policymakers. We also discuss how this approach fosters
innovation, collaboration, and continuous improvement within our development teams.

### Human Centered Approach

### Lean Development


## Contribution Guidelines

Teams are not only welcome but encouraged to propose new modules for the different
tools. The process for collaborating, which is a testament to our shared commitment to
innovation, is as follows:

1. The team must fork the main repository into their own GitHub account.
2. Create a feature branch for the new module using the following convention:
   "feature/new-module"
3. Develop the new module on the feature branch, ensuring to commit regularly. This
   practice is crucial for maintaining a clear and traceable development history.
4. Regularly synchronize the feature branch with the Main repository to avoid conflicts.
5. Once the new module is developed and pushed into your feature branch, create a
   pull request from your fork into the main repository.
6. The e3 Tools maintainers team will review the pull request and, once approved,
   merge it into the develop branch.
7. Once the new module is tested on the develop branch, it will be merged into the
   main branch and released.
