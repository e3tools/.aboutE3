# Grievance Redress Mechanism

A GRM (Grievance Redress Mechanism) is a system designed to receive, evaluate, and resolve complaints or concerns from project stakeholders, especially affected communities. It ensures that people can raise issues related to project impacts—such as land acquisition, environmental harm, or lack of consultation—and have them addressed promptly and fairly. GRMs are a key part of the World Bank’s commitment to transparency, accountability, and social inclusion in development projects.

## GRM Platform

Is designed to be a comprenhensive solution for a Digital GRM implementation. It provides a set of interconnected functionalities and components that allow for easy integration of new features. The platform is divided into the following components:

1. **Monitoring Web Portal**: A web-based interface for project teams to manage and monitor grievances, track resolutions, and generate reports.
2. **Focal Point Mobile App**: A mobile application for focal points to receive, manage, and respond to grievances in the field. It allows for real-time updates and communication with project teams but also allows to collect grievances without internet connection and sync whenever the user reaches an estable internet network.

### Monitoring Web Portal

The Monitoring Web Portal is a web-based interface designed for project teams to manage and monitor grievances. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for tracking grievances, generating reports, and managing user roles and permissions.

#### Tech Stack
Is build on Django using postgres as a database and connects to the Focal Point application using CouchDB and API rest endpoints.

#### Features

- **Dashboard**: Provides an overview of grievances, including status, categories, and trends.
- **Grievance Management**: Allows users to log, track, and resolve grievances.
- **Reporting**: Generates reports on grievance trends, resolutions, and response times.
- **User Management**: Manages user roles and permissions within the system.
- **Automatic Grievance Redirection** Grivances are automatically redirected to the correct agent based on the grievance category and location.
- **Grievance Categories**: Allows users to define and manage grievance categories for better tracking and reporting.
- **Diferent Feedback Types**: Allows users to define not only grievances as a report but also questions, feedback or other relevant types that the project team considers relevant.
- **Administrative Levels Customization**: Allows users to define the administrative levels of the project, such as country, region, district, etc. This allows flexibility to be deployed on any country or region.
- **Multilingual Support**: Teams can add multiple languages using localization.

### Focal Point Mobile App

The Focal Point Mobile app is an offline first tool that allows focal points such as community facilitators or grievance redress committee members to receive, manage, and respond to grievances in the field. It is designed to work seamlessly with the Monitoring Web Portal, ensuring that all grievances are tracked and managed effectively.

#### Tech Stack

Is build on React Native and connects to the Monitoring Web Portal using CouchDB and API rest endpoints.

- **Offline Functionality**: Allows users to collect grievances without an internet connection and sync them when a connection is available.
- **Real-time Updates**: Provides real-time updates on grievance status and resolutions.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use in the field, with intuitive navigation and data entry.
- **Location Tracking**: Automatically captures the location of grievances for better tracking and reporting.
- **Multilingual Support**: Teams can add multiple languages using localization.
- **Manage Greivances**: View grievance resolution process, status, history, rating and appealing process.

## Operationalization

The GRM platform is designed to be deployed in a way that ensures effective grievance management and resolution. This includes:

- **GRM Customization**: The teams are encouraged to fill the [customization form](customization_form.md) to define the grievance categories, administrative levels, and other relevant information for the project.
- **Platform Testing**: The teams are encouraged to [deploy](deployment.md) the platform in a testing environment to test the functionalities and ensure that the platform is working as expected. this can also serve as a training environment for the project teams.
- **Training and Capacity Building**: Provide training to project teams and focal points on how to use the platform effectively.
- **Piloting**: Conduct a pilot phase to test the platform in a real-world setting and gather feedback for improvements.
- **Scale Up**: Once the pilot is successful, scale up the platform to cover all project areas and stakeholders.
- **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Continuously monitor and evaluate the platform's performance, user satisfaction, and grievance resolution rates to ensure its effectiveness and make necessary adjustments.

In the future we will include a repository of examples of GRM customization forms and training materials that can be used as a reference for the project teams. This will help to ensure that the platform is used effectively and that grievances are managed in a timely and efficient manner.
