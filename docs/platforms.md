## E3 Initiative Platforms

Our platforms are designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy integration of new features. In order to achieve this we divide our platforms into the following components.

1. Platforms: The overall tool that provides a comprenhensive set of interconnected functionalities and components.
2. Applications: This are the different tools that compose a platform. Each application is designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks.
3. Modules: These are the individual components that make up an application. Each module is designed to perform a specific function or set of functions within the application.

Here is the list of our current platforms and its applications:

| Platform     | Applications                                                                                                                                                                 |
